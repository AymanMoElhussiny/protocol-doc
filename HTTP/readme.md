## I am tring to explain more about HTTP and HTTPS protocols as these are part of most important protocls that we are dealing with 

## HTTP 
### What is HTTP? 
An HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The HTTP protocol provides communication between different communication systems. When the user makes an HTTP request on the browser, then the webserver sends the requested data to the user in the form of web pages. In short, we can say that the HTTP protocol allows us to transfer the data from the server to the client.

An HTTP is an application layer protocol that comes above the [TCP layer](https://github.com/AymanMoElhussiny/protocol-doc/TCP/README.md). It has provided some standard rules to the web browsers and servers, which they can use to communicate with each other.

An HTTP is a stateless protocol as each transaction is executed separately without having any knowledge of the previous transactions, which means that once the transaction is completed between the web browser and the server, the connection gets lost.
